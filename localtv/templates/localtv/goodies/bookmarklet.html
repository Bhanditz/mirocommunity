  <h2>Goodies | Bookmarklet</h2>
  <div class="helpful rounded">
    A bookmarklet allows you to add videos to your Miro Community site with one
    click, without having to return to your Miro Community homepage.
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>Enable the "bookmarks" toolbar in your browser.</li>
    <li>Drag this link: <a href="javascript:(function(){u='http://{{ sitelocation.site.domain }}/submit_video?from_ajax&bookmarklet&url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href);w=window.open(u,'_blank', 'width=630,height=300,resizable=yes');setTimeout(function(){w.focus();}, 250);})();">Add to {{ sitelocation.site.name }}</a> into the bookmarks toolbar. It will now become a button you can see
while on any website.</li>
 <li>When visiting a webpage with a video you would like to add to your Miro
Community site, simply click on the button now embedded in your bookmarks
toolbar.<br>A new window will pop-up with the second step of the submit process,
giving you a chance to fill in any missing fields and then submit.</li>
  </ol>
