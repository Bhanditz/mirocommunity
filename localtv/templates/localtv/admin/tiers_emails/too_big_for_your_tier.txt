Thanks for using Miro Community! As part of rolling out support for
site levels, we wanted to let you know that we are limiting site features
for free accounts so that we can keep the service running.

You are quite welcome to stay on the service without paying. As a free user,
you'll need to pay attention to the following limits:

* 500 published videos
* 1 site admin
* No custom CSS

The limits you are in excess-of are:

{% if "admins" in warnings %}
* You have more admins than one. Unless you upgrade, we will 
{% endif %}{% if "videos" in warnings %}
* You have {{ video_count }} published video{{ video_count|pluralize}}. Unless you upgrade, we will unpublish the oldest videos to keep you within the limit of 500.{% endif %}

We want your site to be successful. We have some tips on how to use your site in the manual:

Yay you,

The Miro Community Team
