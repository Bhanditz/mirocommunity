Congratulations, {{ short_name }}!

Your new Miro Community site is ready to go at http://{{ site.domain }}/.

{% if in_free_trial %}Your 30-day free trial lasts until midnight on {{ next_payment_due_date }}. If

"basic" before the trial ends and you won't be charged (we'll email you 5 days
before the trial ends to remind you). Otherwise, you'll pay just ${{ tier_obj.dollar_cost }}/month
for the service as long as your account is open. You can upgrade, downgrade,
or cancel any time at http://{{ site.domain}}{% url localtv_admin_tier %}
