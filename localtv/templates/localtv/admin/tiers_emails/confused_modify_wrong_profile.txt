Hi, support team. I'm kind of worried.

A Miro Community site just submitted a payment modification for
a different recurring payment subscription than the one on file.

What can this mean? Probably, it means that the user had two
recurring payments established with this MC site, and that they
changed the one that we didn't expect them to.

Anyway, you should take a look at the site and these PayPal
payment profiles:

The site's domain:
    {{ site_domain }}

You're using this email address with PayPal:
    {{ paypal_email_address }}

The recurring payment profile we have on file:
    {{ profile_on_file }}

The surprising one that we just saw:
    {{ surprising_profile }}

Because I wasn't sure what to do, I ignored the change.

Sincerely,

A confused robot.
