Writing Documentation
=====================

Miro Community uses `Sphinx`_ for documentation, which translates
`reStructuredText`_ files into HTML, PDF, or other formats. The canonical
documentation is compiled and `made available on readthedocs`__, but you can
also use Sphinx to compile the documentation on your local development machine.

.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

If you don't feel like you can write very well, don't sweat it. Write what you
can, and pass it off to someone else to improve. The first draft of a piece of
documentation is hard to write simply because it doesn't exist. Writing it can
give someone else a great starting point.

Here are some good resources on writing documentation:

* `Django's docs on writing documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-documentation/>`_
* `RTFM - wRite The Friendly Manual <http://blip.tv/djangocon/rtfm-write-the-friendly-manual-5573341>`_
