Welcome to Miro Community's documentation!
==========================================

`Miro Community`_ is an open-source video curation platfrom running on
Django_. Rather than uploading videos to yet another place on the internet,
you can leverage videos which have already been uploaded to other services,
such as `blip.tv`_, `Vimeo`_, `YouTube`_, either by importing the videos
individually or by importing RSS/Atom feeds of videos.

Miro Community was originally developed by the `Participatory Culture
Foundation`_ to allow `anyone` to build a community video site, amplifying the
voices of grassroots and citizen media makers and connecting local producers
with local audiences. Over time, the platform has been used by a variety of
other groups, including universities, open-source communities, and more.
