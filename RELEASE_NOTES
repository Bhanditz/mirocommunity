++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* localtv.context_processor is now located at localtv.context_processors.localtv
  and no longer includes "request" in the context. The request can be included
  in the context by adding "django.core.context_processors.request" to the
  TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting.
* request.sitelocation() has been removed in favor of the more explicit
  SiteLocation.objects.get_current().
* localtv.FixAJAXMiddleware was moved to localtv.middleware.FixAJAXMiddleware.
* localtv.SiteLocationMiddleware was moved to
  localtv.middleware.UserIsAdminMiddleware and no longer provides a shortcut
  method for fetching SiteLocations on the request.
